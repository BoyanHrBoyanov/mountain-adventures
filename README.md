# mountain-adventures
React project for SoftUni

For this project I have used SoftUni practice server as a backend and HTML & CSS template for the pages.

# User interface
The idea of the application is logged in users to be able to share their adventures in the mountains.

## Before Login

### Home
When the user navigates to the home page he will see a navigation bar at the top left with Home, Catalog, Login and Register links. Further there are static text and picture and after them there is a section called "Latest stories" which shows the last three shared stories.

### Catalog
Navigating to the Catalog page the user can see all the stories with their pictures and some brief info about them. There is a button "See more" for every story which leads to the Details page of the story. There is a search field as well.

### Details
Here in a table on the right is the technical information about the adventure. In the left side is a picture, description and comment area. Not logged in users can only see the comments but can't leave one.

### Login
Everyone can register in the app with username, email and password and after that can login with email and password.

## Logged in users

### Home
The navigation bar now has Home, Catalog, Create, Profile and Logout links.

### Create
Users can create a story filling all the fields in the form.

### Profile
When the user has some stories he can see them in the Profile page. There and in the Catalog page there is an Edit button for the users' stories.

### Edit
In the Edit page of a story, the user will also find the Delete button

### Details
Now the Comments section under each story is available and users can interact to each other.

### Comments
